# Simod + Resources

Simod combines several process mining techniques to fully automate the generation and validation of BPS models. The only input required by the Simod method is an eventlog in XES format.
Simod + Resources combine the best futures of Simod, though also take into account the specific resources configuration in the process such as availability, costs and roles. Simod + Resources let the user define assignation policies based in their preferences. An assignation policy is defined as how the resources should be arrange in the business process model. Depending on the policy the tool will find the optimal model + resource configuration.

## 1. Configuration
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1.1 System Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - Java SDK 1.8
 - R 4.x
 - RTools 4.x
 - Anaconda Distribution
 - [Git https://git-scm.com/downloads] 

### 1.2 Getting Started

Getting the source code:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dfbaron/SimodR.git
```

### Execution steps without Anaconda
```
cd Simod_recursos_scylla
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution steps with Anaconda 
#### Using terminal
```
cd Simod_recursos_scylla
conda env create -f SimodResourcesEnv.yml (For Windows OS)
conda env create -f SimodResourcesEnvMacOS.yml (For Mac OS Related)
conda activate SimodResourcesEnv[MacOs]
```

## 2. Execution

### 2.1 Data format

The tool assumes the input is composed by a case identifier, an activity label, a resource attribute (indicating which resource performed the activity), and two timestamps: the start timestamp and the end timestamp. The resource attribute is required in order to discover the available resource pools, their timetables, and the mapping between activities and resource pools, which are a required element in a BPS model. We require both start and endtimestamps for each activity instance,
in order to compute the processing time of activities, which is also a required element in a simulation model.
As an extra element for this project, per input log in XES format, is required a description of each resource cost. E.g.
```
<resourcesCost>
		<resource key="Penn Osterwalder" value="10"/>
		....
</resourcesCost>
```

### 2.2 Process configuration
The process can be setup in the file config.ini to execute different user preferences:
```

[EXECUTION][FileName]: XES File name e.g: ProductionEditable.xes
[EXECUTION][Repetitions]: How many iterations of the simulation want to be perform e.g. 1
[EXECUTION][Flag]: Options = 1 or 2. Flag that determines which assignation policy will be perform. Either: 
 - (1) Preferences assignation policy: Finding 'm' clusters with the k most frequent resources performing an specific task, where 'm' represents the number of total activities.
 - (2) Similitude: Clustering resources by a defined percentage of similarity.
[EXECUTION][k]: Variable that represents the k most frequent resources. Range in the form of 'min_k, max_k' e.g '4,8'. Min_k represents the lowest value to start finding the clusters with the k most frequent resources performing an specific task, and max_k represents the upper value of this range.
 - k = 1,21 Recommended configuration for the Purchasing Example Log
 - k = 1,24 Recommended configuration for the Production Example Log
 - k = 1,21 Recommended configuration for the Hospital-Emergency Example Log
[EXECUTION][sim_percentage]: Similarity percentage in case the flag 2 was selected. (Value between 0 and 100. E.g: 0.1)
[EXECUTION][happy_path]: True or False variable that represents the quality assignation policy. In this case the tool will determine the happy path of the process.
[EXECUTION][simulator]: Choose the simulator of preference. For this project we are only using Scylla, for future implementations will be possible to include more simulators though.
[EXECUTION][optimization]: True or False variable that define whenever you want to optimize the search. If this is selected the [OPTIMIZATION] section must be fill out.
[OPTIMIZATION][objective]: Define the variable to optimize. Choose among: flowTime_avg, cost_total, waiting_avg, time_workload_avg.
[OPTIMIZATION][criteria]: Choose the optimization criteria. 'min' for minimization or 'max' for maximization.

```
## 3. Project Folders and files

### 3.1 Project Folders
Besides the modules showed in the previous Architecture image, the project folder have some important folders to take into account.
 - **Config.ini** file. Configuration file for the process.
 - **Main.py** file. Main execution file 
 - **Inputs/**: Folder that contains all the event logs files, the JSON canon model and the BPMN model. 
 - **Outputs/**: Folder that contains all the outputs folders and files of the execution.
    - If the tool performed an optimization process, a new folder starting with "Optimization", and then a timestamp, will be create. This folder contains the following elements:
        - A graph showing the overall results of the execution (kpiResultsGraph.png)
        - A table showing the same results as the graph but in a numeric way (kpiResultsTable.csv)
        - Inside this folder is possible to find one folder, with a timestamps as name, per resource configuration that contains:
            - The event log file (.xes file)
            - The BPMN process file (.bpmn file)
            - Scylla Global configuration file (.xml File)
            - Scylla Simulation configuration file (.xml File)
            - Resources detail table. (Associated Costs, role, activity, etc.)
            - Resource Cluster graph. Graph(s) showing the initial and/or final configuration of the resources.
            - Folder per simulation execution in Scylla containing the following elements (ScyllaSim_rep_1):
                - File that represents the log event of the simulation (.xes file)
                - File that represents the results of the whole simulation (.xml file)
            - Folder that contains the simulation results (ResourceUtilizationResults)
                - CSV table showing the instances data for the simulation (.csv file)
                - CSV table showing the overall process Metadata (.csv file)
                - CSV table showing the resources utilization. Here is possible to see the utilization per role and instances in each role (.csv file)
